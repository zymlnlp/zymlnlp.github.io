# Zeyu Gao - Personal Blog

This is a minimalist static blog showcasing thoughts on finance, technology and personal growth.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies (once):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt --user
   ```
2. Generate the site:
   ```bash
   python3 generate.py
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.

Markdown posts live inside the `posts/` folder. Running `generate.py` will convert them to HTML and update `index.html`.
